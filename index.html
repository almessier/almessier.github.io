      <p>Welcome to my portfolio!
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Alexander, and I am a software developer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I love breaking down problems and
        working through them step-by-step. Being presented with a challenge, and overcoming it, is what drives my
        passion for programming.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        When I am not coding, you could probably catch me going for a run, or socializing with friends over a game of
        poker.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Below, you will find many of the projects I have developed.

        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Alexander, a 30-year-old software developer
        from Milwaukee,
        Wisconsin. I love programming and overcoming the challenges thrown at me. I am constantly thinking critically
        about what's around me and changing my world view based off of those observations. In my spare time, I like to
        play games with friends.
