      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Alexander, and I am a software developer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I love breaking down problems and
        working through them step-by-step. Being presented a challenge, and overcoming it, is what drives my passion for
        programming.

      <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Alexander, a 30-year-old software developer from Milwaukee,
        Wisconsin. I love programming and overcoming the challenges thrown at me. I am constantly thinking critically
        about what's around me and changing my world view based off of those observations. In my spare time, I like to
        play games with friends.</p>
